#  &nbsp;Hi There . . .
**`Game Development Devlog`**

I am Sastha Ruban. I am documenting my daily journey of learning Blender and Unreal Engine 5 for my university final project. My goal is to move from a beginner level to a functional prototype by the end of the semester.

This repository serves as a transparent record of my learning process, covering asset creation, engine implementation, and problem-solving.

**References :**  All tutorial series and reference videos used for learning are cited in individual daily logs

This is fully dedicated to my final year work. Everything documented here is built from scratch with no external templates.
